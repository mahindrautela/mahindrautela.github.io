## 1. Charged particle beam dynamics in particle accelerators
* 6D phase space(x,y,x,px,py,pz) of charged particle bunches evolves under the influence of EM fields along the accelerator. The problem can be thought of as a spatiotemporal dynamical sytem, where the system parameters (like amplitude, phase of RF cavity, magnet strenth, etc.) modulates a charged particle beam. The system has uncertainties in the governing parameters as well as initial distribution of charged particles. The problem is challenging due to uncertainity, high-dimensional parameter space, limited measurements of the beam etc.
* We investigate different aspects of the problem: estimating forward beam dynamics, inverting the beam dynamics, parameter estimation and control with UQ.
