Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I have completed my Ph.D. in 2023 at Indian Institute of Science and Purdue University (Visiting student) under the supervision of Prof. S. Gopalakrishan and Prof. S. Dyke. Before that, I have worked as a project engineer in Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I completed my masters in 2018 from Indian Institute of Space, Science and Technology. More about my [bio/cv](https://mahindrautela.github.io/cv/).

My general research is centered around scientific machine learning for complex systems with core focus on the the following techniques
* Generative AI
* Uncertainity quantification
* Explainable and Trustworthy AI
* Adaptive optimization like Bayesian approaches.

Towards this direction, I was involved in solving forward and inverse problems related to computational and applied mechanics and electromagnetism. I have applied scientific ML in the following scientific domains
* General partial differential equations
* Aerospace structures (Structural Health Monitoring, Wave Propagation analysis)
* Particle accelerators (Accelerator physics)
* Space habitats (Safety and resilience of concept space habitats)
* High-pressure pipe systems (robotics for pipe health monitoring)
