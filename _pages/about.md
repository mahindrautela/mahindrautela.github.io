## About me
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. I earned my Ph.D. in June 2023 from the IISc - Bangalore, with a significant portion of my research conducted at Purdue University as a visiting student. I have worked on hybrid models for inverse problems as a part of my PhD thesis under the guidance of Prof. S. Gopalakrishan and Prof. S. Dyke. Prior to my doctoral studies, I served as a Research Fellow at the IIT- Kanpur, and completed my Master's in 2018 at the IIST - Trivandrum. More about [bio/cv](https://mahindrautela.github.io/bio/).

My primary research interests lie in generative models, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability. I apply novel scientific machine learning methods to solve problems in/related to:

- Beam Dynamics for diagnostics in particle accelerators
- Flow dynamics and Turbulence
- Structural Health Monitoring
- Material Identification
- General PDEs
- Safety and resilience, cyber-physical testing of smart habitats
- Robotics for inspection
