## About me
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. I earned my Ph.D. in June 2023 from the IISc - Bangalore, with a significant portion of my research conducted at Purdue University as a visiting student. I have worked on hybrid models for inverse problems as a part of my PhD thesis under the guidance of Prof. S. Gopalakrishan and Prof. S. Dyke. Prior to my doctoral studies, I served as a Research Fellow at the IIT- Kanpur, and completed my Master's in 2018 at the IIST - Trivandrum. More about [bio/cv](https://mahindrautela.github.io/bio/).

My broader research interests include solving forward and inverse "spatiotemporal dynamical systems" with machine learning methods. Currently, I am developing
- [foundational models for physical systems](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2509.21670).
- [latent evolution models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-68944-0) to learn forward and inverse spatiotemporal dynamics.

Some of areas which I have working/worked on are:
- Charged particle dynamics and Particle accelerators.
- Magnetohyrdodynamics and Tokamaks. 
- Wave Propagation and Structural health monitoring in Aerospace.
- Material Identification in Aerospace Structures.
- Resilence and Cyber-physical testing of Smart habitats.
- Inspection robots.
