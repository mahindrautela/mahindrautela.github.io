## About me
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. I earned my Ph.D. in 2023 from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), with a significant portion of my research conducted at Purdue University as a visiting student. I have worked on hybrid models for inverse problems as a part of my PhD thesis under the guidance of Prof. S. Gopalakrishan and Prof. S. Dyke. Prior to my doctoral studies, I served as a Research Fellow at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, and completed my Master's in 2018 at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST). More about [bio/cv](https://mahindrautela.github.io/bio/).

My primary research interests lie in generative models, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability. I apply novel scientific machine learning methods to solve problems in/related to 
(a) general partial differential equations (PDEs), 
(b) structural health monitoring, 
(c) material properties estimation, 
(d) beam dynamics in particle accelerators, 
(e) plasma physics, 
(f) safety and resilience, cyber-physical testing of smart habitats, and 
(g) robotics for inspection.
