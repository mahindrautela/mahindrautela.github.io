## About me
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. I earned my Ph.D. in June 2023 from the IISc - Bangalore, with a significant portion of my research conducted at Purdue University as a visiting student. I have worked on hybrid models for inverse problems as a part of my PhD thesis under the guidance of Prof. S. Gopalakrishan and Prof. S. Dyke. Prior to my doctoral studies, I served as a Research Fellow at the IIT- Kanpur, and completed my Master's in 2018 at the IIST - Trivandrum. More about [bio/cv](https://mahindrautela.github.io/bio/).

My primary research interests include scientific machine learning, generative models, reinforcement learning, and uncertainty quantification. Currently, I am developing [latent evolution models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-68944-0) to learn spatiotemporal dynamics, with applications spanning charged particle beam dynamics, plasma dynamics, and fluid dynamics.

Overall, my research is dedicated to advancing novel SciML methods for tackling challenges in spatiotemporal dynamics, structural health monitoring, material identification, safety and resilience and cyber-physical testing of smart habitats, and inspection robotics.
