## About me
Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US. I earned my Ph.D. in 2023 from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), with a significant portion of my research conducted at Purdue University as a visiting student. I had the privilege of working under the guidance of Prof. S. Gopalakrishan and Prof. S. Dyke. Prior to my doctoral studies, I served as a Research Fellow at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, and completed my Master's in 2018 at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST). More about [bio/cv](https://mahindrautela.github.io/bio/).

My research interests majorly incline towards generative models, uncertainty quantification and interpretibility. I have applied scientific ML methods for solving general PDEs, structural health monitoring, wave propagation analysis, material property estimation, discovery and design, particle accelerators, safety, resilience, and cyber-physical testing of smart habitats, robotics for inspection. More about my research projects is available [here](https://mahindrautela.github.io/research/).

Beyond research, I enjoy staying active through football, cricket, strength training, and running. These activities help me maintain physical fitness and mental clarity, balancing the demands of my academic work.
