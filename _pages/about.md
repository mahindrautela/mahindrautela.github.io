## About me
Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I have completed my Ph.D. in 2023 at the *Indian Institute of Science* and *Purdue University* (Visiting student) under the supervision of [Prof. S. Gopalakrishan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XLLZjaUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. S. Dyke](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d9f_YvcAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I worked as a project engineer in the department of mechanical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I completed my master's in 2018 from the Indian Institute of Space, Science and Technology. More about my [bio/cv](https://mahindrautela.github.io/cv/). 

At LANL, I am currently working on solving forward and inverse problems related to electrodynamics in particle accelerators. I am deploying generative AI, Bayesian approaches and their combinations for spatiotemporal dynamics (forward) as well as system identification (inverse).

My general research is centered around *scientific machine learning* for complex systems with a core focus on Generative AI, Uncertainty quantification, Explainable and Trustworthy AI and Adaptive optimization like Bayesian approaches. Towards this direction, I was involved in solving forward and inverse problems related to computational and applied mechanics and electromagnetism. 

I have applied scientific ML methods in the following scientific domains like general partial differential equations, aerospace structures (structural health monitoring, wave propagation analysis), material informatics (material property estimation, discovery and design), particle accelerators (Accelerator physics, system identification), space habitats (Safety, resilience, and cyber-physical testing), high-pressure pipe systems (robotics for pipe health monitoring).
