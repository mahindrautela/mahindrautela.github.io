Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory. My general research is centered around scientific machine learning for complex systems with core focus on the application of 
* Generative AI
* Uncertainity quantification
* Explainable and Trustworthy AI
* Adaptive optimization like Bayesian approaches.

I completed my Ph.D. in 2023 at Indian Institute of Science and Purdue University (Visiting student) under the supervision of Prof. S. Gopalakrishan and Prof. S. Dyke. Before that, I have worked for Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur as a project engineer. I completed my masters in 2018 from Indian Institute of Space, Science and Technology. Here is a recent copy of my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rTvdGQsgDmTZJnN-wcGGGuutKXEUAF0P/view?usp=sharing).

I have worked on scientific machine learning, robotics and its applications on complex systems like 
* Aerospace structures
* Particle accelerators
* Space habitats
* High-pressure pipe systems

Towards this direction, I was involved in solving forward and inverse problems related to computational and applied mechanics.
