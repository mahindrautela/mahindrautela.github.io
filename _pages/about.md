## About me
Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US. I have completed my Ph.D. in 2023 at the Indian Institute of Science and Purdue University (Visiting student) under the supervision of [Prof. S. Gopalakrishan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XLLZjaUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. S. Dyke](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d9f_YvcAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I worked as a research fellow in the department of mechanical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I completed my master's in 2018 from the Indian Institute of Space, Science and Technology. More about my [bio/cv](https://mahindrautela.github.io/bio/).

I have applied scientific ML methods for general **PDEs**, aerospace structures (**structural health monitoring**, **wave propagation analysis**), **material informatics** (material property estimation, discovery and design), particle accelerators, space habitats (**safety, resilience, and cyber-physical testing**), high-pressure pipe systems (**robotics** for pipe health monitoring). More about my research projects is available [here](https://mahindrautela.github.io/research/).

At **LANL**, I am currently working on 
* Solving both forward and inverse spatiotemporal dynamical systems, ex: particle accelerators and plasma physics.
* Uncertainity analysis and quantification for spatiotemporal dynamical system.
* Generative models, Bayesian formulations and explainable and trustworthy AI.
